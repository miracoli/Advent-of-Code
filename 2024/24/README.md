### First Part:

- Parses logic gates (AND/OR/XOR) and processes them in a queue, evaluating outputs once all input values are available.

### Second Part:

- Analyzes gates involving `x` and `y` wires to detect XOR/AND operations for bitwise addition.
- Detects mismatches in gate operations (e.g., incorrect XOR/AND usage) or misrouted signals.
- Swaps erroneous gates and outputs a sorted list of corrected wire labels (e.g., `z00,z12`).

### First Part:

1. Reads list of integers line by line from `input.txt`.
2. Checks if the differences between consecutive numbers are between 1 and 3 and the sign of differences is consistent.
3. Counts and prints the number of valid lines based on these conditions.

### Second Part:

- Same as the first part, but attempts to skip each element in the line one by one to find a valid sequence.

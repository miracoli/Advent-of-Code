### First Part:

1. Reads list of integers line by line from `input.txt`.
2. Checks if the differences between consecutive numbers are between 1 and 3 and the sign of differences is consistent.
3. Counts and prints the number of valid lines based on these conditions.

### Second Part:

- Similar to the first approach, but if an error is detected, we evaluate whether skipping the current or previous element restores the sequence's validity.

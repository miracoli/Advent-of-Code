### First Part:

- Simply reads the list of instructions, executes them sequentially, and prints the computed values to the console.

### Second Part:

- Uses **recursive backtracking** to find valid initial values for `A` that reproduce the target output sequence.
- Operates in reverse through the output to validate candidates efficiently.
- Constrained to **octal digit ranges** due to bitwise operations on `A`.

Below is one way to "translate" the program into a high level pseudo-code form. The input program
is interpreted as eight pairs of (opcode, operand). Mapping each pair according to the original instruction set gives:

    Pair 0: (2, 4)
    Opcode 2 (bst):
    Computes: = comboValue(4, A, B, C) & 7
    Since operand 4 returns A (for operands â‰¥ 4, operand 4 returns A), this becomes:
    B = A & 7 which is equivalent to B = A % 8

    Pair 1: (1, 5)
    Opcode 1 (bxl):
    Computes: B ^= operand
    B = B XOR 5

    Pair 2: (7, 5)
    Opcode 7 (cdv):
    Computes: C = A / (1 << comboValue(5, A, B, C))
    For operand 5, comboValue(5, A, B, C) returns B, so this is:
    C = A / 2^(B)

    Pair 3: (1, 6)
    Opcode 1 (bxl) again:
    Computes: B = B XOR 6
    B = B XOR 6

    Pair 4: (4, 2)
    Opcode 4 (bxc):
    Computes: B ^= C (operand isnâ€™t used here)
    B = B XOR C

    Pair 5: (5, 5)
    Opcode 5 (out):
    Computes: OUT (comboValue(5, A, B, C) & 7)
    For operand 5, comboValue(5, A, B, C) returns B so:
    OUT B % 8

    Pair 6: (0, 3)
    Opcode 0 (adv):
    Computes: A = A / (1 << comboValue(3, A, B, C))
    For operand 3 (which is less than 4) the value is just 3, so:
    A = A / 2^3

    Pair 7: (3, 0)
    Opcode 3 (jnz):
    Computes: if (A != 0) JMP to instruction pointer = operand
    Here, operand is 3, so:
    if A != 0 JMP 0

Putting it all together in short form:

    B = A % 8
    B = B XOR 5
    C = A / 2^(B)
    B = B XOR 6
    B = B XOR C
    OUT B
    A = A / 2^3
    if A != 0 JMP 0

#### Key Observations
1. **Dependency Chain**: 
   - `B` and `C` derive entirely from `A`'s initial value.
   - Only `A` needs to be reverse-engineered.
   
2. **Octal Constraints**:
   - `B = A % 8` forces 3-bit granularity for `A`.
   - `A = A // 8` iteratively processes octal digits right-to-left.

3. **Search Space**:
   - Valid solutions must match all output digits when `A` is decomposed into octal digits.
   - Backtracking tests candidate octal digits at each step of the reverse simulation.

## First Part:

1. Read two integer lists from the file `input.txt`.
2. Sort both lists.
3. Calculate the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements using `std::inner_product`.

## Second Part:

1. Read integer pairs from the file `input.txt`.
2. Store the first integers in a vector and the second integers' frequencies in an unordered map.
3. Calculate the weighted sum using `std::accumulate`, where each element from the first list is multiplied by its corresponding frequency from the second list.

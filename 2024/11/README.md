### First Part:

- The key insight is to use an unordered_map to efficiently handle transformations each round, avoiding repeated processing of the same values. This approach prevents the list from growing excessively large, which would make it impractical for higher blink counts.

### Second Part:

- Same as the first part, but with 75 instead of 25 blinks.

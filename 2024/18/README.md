### First Part:
- Reads grid data from `input.txt`, marks blocked cells.
- Uses BFS to calculate the shortest path and outputs the distance.

### Second Part:
- Similar to Part One, but checks if the path exists.
- Inserts cells one by one until the path becomes unsolvable.
- Outputs the coordinates of the last inserted cell when the path becomes unsolvable.
